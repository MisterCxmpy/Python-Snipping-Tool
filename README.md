# Python-Snipping-Tool
A remake of Windows Snip tool using Python

The names says it all. It is simply a remake of the Windows Snip tool.
I made the program because I didn't like using the Snip as it didn't automatically save the images.
Once you take a snip of the screen it will create a folder in the same location where the file is,
in the folder is where you will find all the images that you have taken.
